** Task Tracker** is a CLI project used to trarck and manage your tasks.
Challenge from task-tracker: https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

## Features

- **List tasks** by status: `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`, or all tasks.

- **Delete tasks** by ID.
- Runs inside **Docker**, so you donâ€™t need to install Go locally.
- Task data is persisted in a JSON file.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

   cd yask-tracker

   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
